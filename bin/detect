Error: Your app is configured to use the .NET buildpack, but we
couldn't find a supported .NET solution, project or file-based app.

A .NET app on Heroku must have a .NET solution ('.sln', '.slnx'),
project ('.csproj', '.vbproj', '.fsproj') or C# ('.cs') file in
the root directory of its source code.

Currently the root directory of your app contains:

$(ls -1A --indicator-style=slash "${BUILD_DIR}" || true)

If your app already has a solution, project or C# file, check that it:

1. Is in the top-level directory (not a subdirectory).
2. Isn't listed in '.gitignore' or '.slugignore'.
3. Has been added to the Git repository and committed.

Otherwise, add a .NET solution, project or file-based app to your
app's root directory.
