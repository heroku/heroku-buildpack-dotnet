#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Usage: bin/report <build-dir> <cache-dir> <env-dir>

# Produces a build report containing metadata about the build for the build system.
# This script is executed for both successful and failing builds.
#
# Metadata must be emitted to stdout as valid YAML key-value pairs. Any fields
# that should always be typed as a string must be explicitly quoted.
#
# Example valid stdout:
#    sdk_version_requirement: '^8.0'
#    sdk_download_attempts: 1
#
# Failures in this script don't cause the overall build to fail (and won't appear in user
# facing build logs) to avoid breaking builds unnecessarily / causing confusion. To debug
# issues check the internal build system logs for `buildpack.report.failed` events, or
# when developing run `make run` in this repo locally, which runs `bin/report` too.
