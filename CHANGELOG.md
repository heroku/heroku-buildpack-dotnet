- The buildpack will now set `--artifacts-path` to a temporary directory during `dotnet publish`. This change reduces the number of unused, duplicated and/or intermediate files in the app directory. Published output for each project is still written to the same location relative to the the project directory (`bin/publish`, as configured using the `PublishDir` property). ([#49](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-dotnet/pull/49))
